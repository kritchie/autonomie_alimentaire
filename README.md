# Objectives

- Automate my vegetable production to fulfill 100% of my needs. 
- Reduce my carbon footprint over time. 
- Describe my experiences so other can do similar things. 

# Disclaimer

- This project is intended to serve as documentation for how I build **MY** own garden automation.

Stay safe and keep growing!
