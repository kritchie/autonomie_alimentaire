# Bill of Materials (BOM)

This is the components used for realizing V1.

- **Raspberri pi b+ v1**: Yes.. the "old" 2014 one. With the WiFi dongle to make your life easier...
- **ELEGOO 5V 4 channels relay**: This will allow using the Rpi GPIOs to activate/deactivate the valve. 
- **12V DC solenoid hose valve**: 300mA nominal current
- **5V power supply**: To power the Rpi
- **12V 1A power supply**: To power the valve
- **Weatherproof electric box**: To be able to leave the eletronics outside.
- **Powerbar**: Install in the electric box to power the electronics from the house's power.
- **capacitive humidity sensors**: I've used 4 of them for now, 

Not part of the materials, but you'll probably need:

- Computer (duh)
- Workbench
- Electronics soldering kit
- Voltmeter
- Wires and resistances
